        <h2>Why Your Support Matters</h2>
        <p>I am dedicated to sharing the authentic knowledge of Vedic Astrology with anyone eager to learn, without seeking any monetary gain. My mission is to make this ancient wisdom accessible to all, enabling students to understand life better, protect themselves from false astrologers, and live with peace and harmony.</p>

        <p>While this course and all future classes are completely free of charge, I humbly invite those who wish to support this initiative to consider making a donation.
